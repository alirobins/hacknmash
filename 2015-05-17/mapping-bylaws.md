Coordinates.com  - has free geospatial data – conservation lands, telecoms data, payhpone locations etc

Use Google earth  pro –  sign up for free

take your iamge from the pdf. 
Save the jpg image on your desktop

Then go to google earth pro
Overlay your image from the desktop 
Then change transparenc y so you can see through it

Add pin points , draw lines/boundaries etc

You can clamp it to the  ground or make it relative to the ground - (relative  - you can make a building height etc)

Can resize image to overlay on google maps. Then track a path around the boundary  – right click – save place as (save as KML file) 

Then go to mymaps – google create a new map – drop kml onto google, mymaps  (or import into google, mymaps), change base map then edit boundary then publish.

Go to google earth balloons  -you can create a web page within the balloon...
